## Dicee Game
# Introduction
The Dicee Game is a simple and fun web-based application where two players compete against each other by rolling dice. The game is designed to be light-hearted and easy to use, with a minimalistic interface and straightforward functionality. The primary purpose of the game is to determine a winner based on the outcome of the dice rolls.

This project serves as an excellent practice for beginners in web development, focusing on the integration of HTML and CSS to create interactive web pages. The game showcases how these technologies can be combined to build a fully functioning, user-friendly application.

# How the Game Works
The Dicee Game consists of two dice, one for each player. When the webpage is refreshed, both dice are rolled simultaneously, and the numbers on the dice determine the outcome of the game. The player with the higher number on their die is declared the winner. If both players roll the same number, the game results in a draw.

# Detailed Steps:
# 1. Interface:

The game interface consists of a header displaying the title, "Refresh Me," encouraging players to refresh the page to roll the dice.
Two sections labeled "Player 1" and "Player 2" show the respective dice for each player.
# 2. Game Logic:

Upon loading the page, JavaScript code randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 for each die.
The corresponding dice images are displayed based on these numbers.
The game logic then compares the numbers and dynamically updates the page to display the winner, or declare a draw.
Player Experience:

The simplicity of the game makes it easily accessible for all ages.
The use of vibrant colors and playful fonts enhances the user experience, making the game visually appealing and engaging.

# 3. Educational Value
The Dicee Game is not only a fun project but also a valuable learning tool. It introduces key web development concepts such as:
